## Image Management Scripts

The project includes several scripts in the `scripts/` directory to manage images and their verification status. All scripts support batch processing with the `--batch=N` argument.

### Available Scripts

#### 1. Image Verification (`verify-images.js`)

Verifies images using the [API Ninjas Object Detection API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/objectdetection) to ensure images correctly represent their associated words.

**Setup:**
1. Get an API key from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   NINJAS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Verify all unverified images
npm run images:verify

# Verify only pending images
npm run images:verify:pending

# Verify with debug logs
npm run images:verify -- --debug

# Process first 10 images (batch mode)
npm run images:verify -- --batch=10
```

**Features:**
- Uses AI object detection to verify image content
- Three-state verification: 'yes', 'invalid', 'pending'
- Confidence threshold >= 70% with English word matching
- Uses local images from `public/images/` when available
- Caches results to avoid redundant API calls
- Skips already verified images

**Verification Status:**
- `verified: 'yes'` - Image correctly represents the word (confidence >= 70%)
- `verified: 'invalid'` - Image doesn't match or has low confidence
- `verified: 'pending'` - Needs verification

#### 2. Image Generation (`generate-images.js`)

Generates images for invalid entries using the [HuggingFace Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

**Setup:**
1. Get an API token from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Make sure it has "Make calls to Inference Providers" permission
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. Optionally set a different model:
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_MODEL_ID=stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
   ```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate images for all invalid entries
npm run images:generate

# Process first 5 entries (batch mode)
npm run images:generate -- --batch=5

# Enable debug logs
npm run images:generate -- --debug
```

**Features:**
- Generates kid-friendly cartoon images using AI
- Saves images to `public/images/` directory
- Updates `gameData.js` with local image paths (`/images/filename.jpg`)
- Sets `verified: 'pending'` for generated images (ready for verification)
- Uses router endpoint: `https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/{model_id}`
- Default model: `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`

**Note**: After generating images, run `npm run images:verify` to verify them.

#### 3. Image Status Update (`update-images.js`)

Updates verification status based on local file existence in the `public/images/` directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Update all entries
npm run images:update

# Process first 20 entries (batch mode)
npm run images:update -- --batch=20
```

**Features:**
- Checks if image files exist in `public/images/` directory
- Sets `verified: 'yes'` if file exists
- Sets `verified: 'pending'` if file doesn't exist
- Only processes local image paths (skips external URLs)
- Only updates status if it has changed
- Shows summary of updates

**Use Cases:**
- After downloading images, update their verification status
- After generating images, mark them as ready for verification
- Quick status check of local image files

#### 4. Image Summary (`summarize-images.js`)

Displays a summary of all images in the game data, including verification status and difficulty distribution.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run images:summary
```

**Output:**
- Total number of images
- Verification status counts (Verified, Invalid, Pending)
- Difficulty distribution by language (Easy, Medium, Hard for English and Portuguese)
- Only verified images are counted in difficulty statistics

**Example Output:**
```
📊 Image Summary

- Total images: 77
- Verified: 38
- Invalid: 4
- Pending: 35

Difficulty counts (verified only):
- Easy, en: 20, pt: 11
- Medium, en: 18, pt: 26
- Hard, en: 0, pt: 1
```

### Script Workflow

A typical workflow for managing images:

1. **Generate images** for invalid entries:
   ```bash
   npm run images:generate
   ```

2. **Update status** based on file existence:
   ```bash
   npm run images:update
   ```

3. **Verify generated images**:
   ```bash
   npm run images:verify
   ```

4. **View summary** of all images:
   ```bash
   npm run images:summary
   ```

### Batch Processing

All scripts support batch processing to limit the number of entries processed:

```bash
# Process first 10 entries
npm run images:verify -- --batch=10
npm run images:generate -- --batch=10
npm run images:update -- --batch=10
```

This is useful for:
- Testing scripts with a small subset
- Processing large datasets in chunks
- Avoiding API rate limits
